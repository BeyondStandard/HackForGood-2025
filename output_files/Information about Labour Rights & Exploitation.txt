What do you need to know?: By Dutch Law it is decided that you are not allowed to work without a working permit. This means that as an undocumented migrant you are legally not allowed to work. However, many undocumented migrants do have a job to sustain their lives. By having a job you are entitled to some rights, even if you have no working permit or the right documents. 

**What are you rights as a worker?**
- Right to minimum wage 
- Right to holiday payment 
- Right to a good and safe working environment
- Right to get paid when you are ill 
- Right to 16 weeks maternity leave

**This is how you can protect your rights:**
- Know your rights, even if you do not have the right documents like a working permit, you have rights when you work.  
- Beware of a job that sounds too good to be true
- Make sure that someone you trust is aware of where you are and where you work
- Discuss your salary, hours and when you get paid with your employer 
- Ask for a contract in a language you understand and also ask for a copy 
- Gather proof of where you work, such as a contract, work agreements, photos. Keep track of your worked hours and how much you are paid. This is important if things do go wrong!
