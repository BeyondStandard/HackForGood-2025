Pregnancy Care 

Offer Name: How to get shelter when you are pregnant 
What service?: Pregnant women are entitled to shelter in an AZC for a period of 6 weeks before birth and up to and including 6 weeks after birth. 
What do you need to know?: How to apply for this shelter:

Ask the midwife for a statement stating the date of delivery. This statement must be sent to the IND together with an application for 'postponement of departure'. The IND will then send a letter with information about when the right to shelter starts and at which asylum seekers' center the woman must report.

The pregnant woman can also travel to the Ter Apel application center with the statement from the midwife. This is allowed 6 weeks before the birth. After registering in Ter Apel, the woman will stay there for a few nights. Then she is sent to an asylum seekers' center.
