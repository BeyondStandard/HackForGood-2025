You can also go to Doctors of the World, who are specialized in helping people without documents, for a referral. You can find more information about this organisation on this website under 'Doctor'.

It is important to find a doctor that is close to you. Most doctors work within their own postal district. This is the reason why the doctor will ask you for your home address. This information will not be shared with others. If you have no home address you can also share this with your doctor.
