## Overview
Imagine arriving in a new city, facing an unfamiliar language and needing urgent assistance.
This is a problem that afflicts many people including refugees, asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants.
The current interface is slow, not particularly accessible but still manages to be overwhelming.

Our project seeks to improve this experience by streamlining access to critical resources through a combination of intelligent navigation, UI revamp,  and AI-driven support agents.
Built for the Red Cross, this platform offers an intuitive interface and a multilingual chatbot backed by real-time information from a dynamic content management system (CMS).

- **Text-based:** Type questions directly into the chatbot interface.
- **Voice-based:** Dial +31 970 102 500 66 to speak to the chatbot and receive spoken responses via Twilioâ€™s integration.

## Features

### 1. Simplified Website Structure, Revamped UI

### 4. Multi-Channel Support

### 5. Automated and Updated CMS System  
- Data integrity is maintained through an easy-to-use CMS that automatically updates the entire platform. Adding new content is fast, secure, and requires minimal effort.
